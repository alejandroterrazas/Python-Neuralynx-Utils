# Python-Neuralynx-Utils
Python code to process data produced by Neuralynx Cheetah data acquisition systems

These utilities are needed for most analayses of data acquired on Cheetah.  

1) VideoUtils.py is used for reading and writing position tracking data.  

2) EEGUtils.py is used for reading, filtering and writing EEG files.  Also included are finding theta peaks and troughs.

3) TetrodeUtils.py is used for reading and processing electrode recordings

4) GeneralUtils.py has several fuctions for findiing nearest timestamps for non-syncrhonized recordings.
